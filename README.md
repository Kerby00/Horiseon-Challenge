# Horiseon-Challenge
This repo contains the original and updated source code for the Horiseon Inc. Website challenge. All code was updated for proper headings, style and assessibility. All headers fall in sequantial order. All images have alt/title discriptions. The wibsite had a proper name. All elements follow semantic vs non semantics html.
